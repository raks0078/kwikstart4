Although KWIKSTARTER has taken steps and used its best endeavour against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance of the KWIKSTARTER Platform and its services, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, and that KWIKSTARTER&lsquo;s enhanced security measures will be effective. Any significant breach of KWIKSTARTER&lsquo;s security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of KWIKSTARTER&lsquo;s network or services, including the KWIKSTARTER Platform, may adversely affect KWIKSTARTER Tokens.

Notwithstanding the preceding, a party may disclose information to the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfil a legal duty, protect, or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings. This confidentiality provision will survive the termination of these Terms and any arbitration brought under these Terms.
<br/>
